# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is dealing with version control every time we iterate on our code we make a new git. Github is the site we use to manage and share our gits or all of the different versions of the code we produce.

Researched answer: Git is a distributed version control system. It tracks changes in any set of files, typically used for coordinating work amongst programmers. Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) Github is designed as a Git repository hosting service. It is exclusively cloud based. You can share code with others, giving them the power to make revisions or edits.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:  &&, ||, ==, ===

Researched answer: There are three JavaScript operators that will return boolean values. They are AND &&, OR ||, and NOT !.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the address system used in arrays. Every element in an array has an associated index. The difference between an index and a value is the content inside of an element whereas the index is the address for that element

Researched answer: Indexes are sequential numbers that are a bit like an address for every element in an array. The content of each element is called the value.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Strings are just bunches of characters put together inside of "". Arrays are used more to manipulate data. Arrays can be converted to strings and vice versa. Arrays use [].

Researched answer: An Array is a collection of similar type of elements that are stored in a contiguous memory location. A string is an object that represents a sequence of characters. Arrays are mutable which means they be grow or be mutated. Strings are not mutable, so whenever a change is made to a string, an entirely new string is created.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:In pair programming you have one driver and one navigator. The driver is in charge of writing the actual code. They share their screen with their partner and are the ones in control. The navigator is there to help the driver. If the driver doesn't know what to write or where to go, it's the navigators job to get them back on track. The navigator is also in charge of making sure the driver doesn't have any typos. If the driver needs more information on a specific topic its the navigators job to find the information. Take turns however you decide to, whether that be time or # of problems worked on.

Researched answer: I'm not sure where I can research this more.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Functions that return a function and/or use a function as a parameter.

2. Jest: This is a program or something that we will use to test our code

3. Objects: A standalone entity, with properties and type.

4. Method: A function which is a property of an object

5. Classes: Template for creating an object
